I am a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at NYU Tandon School of Engineering, advised by [Farshad Khorrami](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/farshad-khorrami) at the [Control/Robotics Research Laboratory (CRRL)](http://crrl.poly.edu/). My interests lie in the fields of robotics, computer vision, machine learning, and security. Specifically, I am interested in developing robust fusion and risk-aware algorithms for cyber-physical systems.

My current research attempts to find shortcomings in learning-based system for perception and control of autonomous systems and develop algorithms to overcome the same. Through various collaborations through my lab (Control/Robotics Research Lab, NYU), I have worked on the problems related to navigation, mapping and localization, and hardware security.
