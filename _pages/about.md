I am a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at NYU Tandon School of Engineering, advised by [Prof. Farshad Khorrami](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/farshad-khorrami) at the [Control/Robotics Research Laboratory (CRRL)](http://crrl.poly.edu/). My interests lie in the fields of robotics, computer vision, machine learning, and security. 

Specifically, I am interested in developing robust and secure algorithms for perception-based cyber-physical systems. My current research attempts to find shortcomings in these systems and develop algorithms to overcome the same.
